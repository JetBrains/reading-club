## Goal

- promote reading papers
- rise awareness on current research directions in PL, SE, and ML communities
- create opportunity for collaborations


## How it works

Every month we pick and discuss a paper online, in English. We expect everyone to read the paper beforehand. We will try our best to invite one of the paper authors for a Q&A session.

Anyone can add a comment the sessions's document on [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ERtBPYEpYPA6DYKWDrvxpwVfKyyQjTBq) with questions or things that are worth clarifying.
